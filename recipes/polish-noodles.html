    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Assorted vegetables with a ground beef stuffing that will melt in your mouth! My all-time favorite food to eat. My dad was born and raised in Iran and this is a recipe passed down for generations. I wanted to share this with others because all my friends bug me or my dad to make dolma. It's a big hit! You can stuff all kinds of vegetables, like tomatoes, or different kinds of squash, or use grape leaves as well, so feel free to experiment. I hope everyone enjoys the dolma as much as me and my family have for years.
