    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta noodles with rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese mixture, and gooey melted mozzarella. The dish begins with a hearty meat sauce made by saut√©ing ground beef and Italian sausage with onions and garlic, then simmering the mixture with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of herbs and spices for a robust flavor. This sauce is layered between sheets of cooked lasagna noodles, alternating with a mixture of ricotta cheese, egg, and parsley that adds a creamy texture and richness to the dish. </p>

    <p>The assembly of lasagna involves spreading a thin layer of meat sauce in a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, ricotta mixture, and shredded mozzarella cheese. These layers are repeated, typically three or four times, ending with a final topping of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Baked until bubbly and golden, lasagna is a comforting, satisfying meal that brings together a medley of flavors and textures in every bite. Once out of the oven, it is often allowed to rest briefly to set before being sliced and served, making it perfect for family gatherings and special occasions.</p>
